what is Javascript 
	Javascript is a scripting language, which can be used to perform client side scripting or server side scripting
Introduction to Javascript
	mainly javascript is used for client side scripting 
	we can develop dynamic web pages 
	we can modify html content , onclick='getElementById("html_id").innerHTML="modified Content"' 
	we can modify html attributes, onclick='getElementById("Attribute_id").Attribute="modified Content"'
	we can modify css conetnt , onclick='getElementById("html_id").style.Attribute="modified Content"'
	we can hide/unhide display content, onclick='getElementById("id").style.display="none/block"'  , none for hide and block for unhide
where to write js script tags
	inline text, same line on html 
	defining js text under script tag, scripts tag can be deinied under head tag or inside body tag
	external file, by using script tag including that external file in html 
Displaying Output 
	innerHTML, with the help of id we will display conetnt
	wirte, document.write("content"), without id we can display content
	alert, window.alert("content"), alert message on entering webpage
	console, console.log("content"), which will display content on console, to open console press F12
	print, onclick="print()", when ever user enters print button it will allow user to download webpage as pdf
Identifiers 
	Indentifies are nothing but varibale names or function names or constants
	can be started with letter(a-z) or underscore(_) ,  ex:- abc, _abc
	special characters are not allowed except '$' and '_'  ex:- hello$, Hello$_hi
	keywords cannot be used as Indentifies   ex:- break(invalid)
varibales
	varibales are declared using var keyword and thier paticular values of that varibales are assigned using assignment operator(=)
Datatypes
	In Javascript we have
		numbers ,  ex:- 1, 2.3 , even the float/decimal values are considered as numbers 
		string , ex:- 'hello', "hello", "hello's", 'hello"s' 
		boolean , ex:- true, false
		object(Array, name:value) , ex;- [1,2,3], {name:'shannu', age : 28}
		undefined , ex:- var a,  varibales which are declared but not initialized with values 
	Accessing elements in objects 
		var a=[1,2,4,5] 
			with the help of index posistion we can access elements , ex:- a[0], a[2] which gives 1,4
		var b={name:'shannu', age : 34}
			with the help of varibale we can access value , ex:- b.name, b.age which gives shannu, 34
Functions
	User Defined Functions
		Fucntions are declared using keyword function()
			Ex:- function fun_name(paranthesis){
				statement
				return
			}
		Here, paranthesis is input and statement is logic 
Conditional Statements
	if , else if, else 
	syntax:- if (condition)					if (condition)
				{								{
					statement						statement
				}								}
			 else if (condition)			else 
			 	{								{
					statement						statement
				}								}
			 else 
			 	{
					statement
				}
Switch Case
	if we need to check multiple selection , then we will consider siwth Case
	in siwth case, if given expression/value matches with anyone one of the label then it will excute that associated statement
	if we won't pass break then it will goes on continously checking all lablel
	break will take control out of switch case 
	In case of (expression/value) it will take only int,char,expression
	syntax : switch (expression/value)
				{
			case label 1 : statement;
							break;
			case label 2 : statement;
							break;
			case label 3 : statement;
							break;
			default : statement ;
						break;
				}	
Iterative Statements
	To excute multiple statement , we consider loops
	for and while loop											initilization;				
	syntax :- for (initilization; condition; updation)							while(condition)
					{										{	
						statement;									statement;
					}											updation;
															}	

Numbers
	In javascript , irrespective of Datatypes we can intialize varibales with var keyword
	In javascript , '6' is Numeric string    and   'ABC' is string
	In javascript , integer and decimal precision will have limit upto 15 digits for integer and 17 for decimal precision, after that it will give inaccurate values
	for numbers , while concatinating with string or performing some operations will show some different characters
	in Javascript , interpreter will consider from left to right , so that if addition is there it will add and do remaining operations
	In Addition
		8+2=10        int and int
		'8'+2=82		from left we have string , Here it will take it as string and string and return a string by concatinating  
		2+2+'8'=48		from left we have num , num, string, so here from left first it will add firt two and then it concatinate string 	
		'8'+2+2=822		from left we have string, so it will concatinate and then concatinated string will be again concatinated as string
	For remaining operations , it will remain same and whether it is numeric string or number it will consider it as int
		8-2=6		integer and integer
		'8'-'2'=6	here , we have numeric string and numeric string but it will consider it as integer and it will perform regular operation
		2-'8'=-6	here, integer and Numeric string , string will be consider as integer and perform regular expression
		'20'*10=200 here , Numeric string and integer , it will consider it as integer and multiplied 
		'20'/'10'=2		here, Numeric string and Numeric string , it will consider it as integer and divided
		'2'/0=Infinity  here, Numeric string and integer , it will consider it as integer and divided , which resulted infity because divided by zero
		'2'/'abc'=Nan   here, it is numeric string and string , so it will return Nan(Not a number)
